# 2048-Game-Clone
A simple web-based clone of the popular 2048 game. This project is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a 4x4 grid where players can slide numbered tiles to combine them. The goal is to reach the 2048 tile by merging similar numbers. The game logic is written in JavaScript, and the design is minimal, using CSS grid for layout.
